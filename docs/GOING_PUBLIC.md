# Going public

A repository stays private by default, which means going public is a deliberate
event, not a setting you flip on a whim. It is also close to irreversible: once
a repository is public, its entire history — including whatever was in it
before anyone thought to check — can be cloned, forked, and indexed by the
time a problem is noticed. Fix what needs fixing first.

This checklist exists because Stock itself went through it. Most items below
trace directly to something that was actually missing or actually wrong here,
not anticipated in advance. One is a considered extension of an
already-proven practice rather than something that broke here — see
[Stock ADR 0015](decisions/stock-0015-going-public-checklist.md) for exactly
which is which, and why that distinction is worth stating plainly rather than
blurring.

**This runs once**, immediately before a repository's visibility actually
changes — not on every change the way [`docs/UAT.md`](UAT.md)'s cases do, and
not part of [`docs/RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md)'s per-version sequence. If a
project stays private for years and only later decides to go public, work this
list fresh at that point rather than trusting whatever was true when the
project was grafted.

## 1. License and copyright

- Confirm a `LICENSE` file exists and states a **deliberate** choice. Silence
  is not neutral — no `LICENSE` means default exclusive copyright, which
  blocks anyone else from legally using or forking what you are about to
  share.
- Confirm the copyright holder is an actual legal person or entity — not a
  project or repo name that is not itself a legal entity. See
  [Stock ADR 0014](decisions/stock-0014-license-and-copyright.md) for the
  worked reasoning and the same question asked and answered for real.
- If the license uses a `NOTICE` file (Apache-2.0 and similar), check any
  cross-references inside it actually resolve. Stock's own `NOTICE` shipped
  with a dangling pointer to sections of two other files that didn't mention
  what it claimed — caught only once a real re-sync onto another project
  wrote its own `NOTICE` and declined to copy the mistake forward.
- Record the decision as an ADR. This is exactly the kind of deliberate
  choice a future reader might otherwise mistake for drift.

## 2. Full-history secret scan

A pre-commit secret scanner only guards commits made after it was installed.
Going public exposes everything before that too — worth checking even though
no leak has ever actually been found here; a scanner's clean track record
going forward says nothing about history it was never watching.

- Scan the **entire** history, not just the working tree:
  `git log --all -p --diff-merges=cc` (plain `-p` skips merge-commit diffs
  by default, so a secret introduced only during a merge's manual conflict
  resolution — and later removed — would produce no output at all; verified
  directly, not assumed), checked against common credential patterns (cloud
  provider keys, private key blocks, common API token shapes) — not just the
  scanner's own baseline.
- Also run the project's own scanner across the current tree
  (`detect-secrets scan --all-files` or equivalent) as a second, narrower
  pass, and confirm any hits are in gitignored/untracked paths, not tracked
  content.

## 3. Cross-repo reference check

Grep the whole repository for links to other repositories — sibling
projects, forks, related work referenced in ADRs, changelogs, or skills:

```bash
grep -rln "github.com/<your-org>/" --include='*.md' .
```

For every match, confirm the linked repository is **already public**, or will
go public in the same window. A link into a repository that stays private
becomes a dead link the moment this one goes public — a 404 or a login
prompt for anyone who clicks through, with no way for them to know why.
Stock's own review found exactly this: six references across `CHANGELOG.md`,
ADRs, and a skill file, all pointing at repositories that were still private
when this one went public.

## 4. Stale conditional wording sweep

Grep for words whose truth depends on the repository's current state:
`private`, `internal`, `confidential`, `not yet released`, `unreleased`.
Every hit needs a judgment call, not a reflexive edit:

- Is it still true?
- Was it ever actually the *real* reason for whatever it's justifying — or
  just a convenient-sounding one that happened to also be true at the time?
  Stock's own `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` had exactly this problem: it attributed
  a workflow to the repository being private, when the actual cause (Claude
  Code session owner-scoping) had nothing to do with visibility at all.

## 5. A final, whole-repository stranger read

Every individual change already gets a "read as a stranger" pass — see
[`docs/UAT.md`](UAT.md) case 4. That happens per diff, though, not across the
whole repository at once. Before flipping visibility, do one more pass over
the repository **as it will actually appear** to a first-time visitor:
`README.md`, every doc, and anything in git history a stranger might
plausibly go looking at (author names, commit messages, anything that reads
as more personal than it needs to).

This is human-judgment work, the same shape as `docs/UAT.md`'s own cases: an
agent can read the repository and report what it saw, but it cannot be the
one to decide the repository is ready. Only a person can.

## 6. Flip visibility — once everything checkable beforehand is settled

Only once items 1–5 are done. The same principle as *Context Is Not Content*
applies here, just at the scale of a whole repository instead of one file:
the window closes at the moment of the flip, not at the moment someone
notices a problem, and there is no undo that reaches whatever was already
cloned, forked, or indexed in between.

This is not, in fact, the last step — see below. It only feels that way
because it's the irreversible one.

## 7. GitHub-side repository settings — now that the repo is public

**Branch protection specifically cannot happen before step 6.** Confirmed
directly by the repo owner's own attempt in the GitHub UI, not assumed in
advance: GitHub refused to let Stock's own private repository configure
branch protection at all — account-plan-dependent, most likely, though that
specific mechanism wasn't independently verified, only the refusal itself.
So this step necessarily comes *after* the flip, not before it, however
much tidier "settle everything, then flip" would have been. None of it is
checkable or settable by an agent session either way, as of this writing —
no tool access to GitHub's branch-protection API. It's a manual pass, in
Settings → Branches (or the newer Rulesets UI, depending on what your
account shows).

- **Require a pull request before merging** on the default branch. Turns
  "changes reach `main` by branch and PR, never a direct commit" from a
  written convention into something GitHub actually enforces.
- **Require the project's CI status check to pass** before merging.
- **Disallow force pushes** to the default branch. This is the one that
  matters most — though precisely: a tag is an independent ref, and
  force-pushing the default branch cannot move, delete, or otherwise affect
  an existing tag, which keeps pointing at the exact same commit regardless.
  The real risk is different: a force-push (even an accidental one) can
  rewrite the default branch's history so a previously-tagged commit is no
  longer an *ancestor* of it, breaking `docs/RELEASING.md`'s "one continuous
  history" model even though the tag itself still resolves correctly.
- **Disallow deletion** of the default branch.
- Check whether CI secrets (coverage tokens, review-bot tokens, and similar)
  are scoped sensibly now that Actions run logs become publicly visible.
- Repo description and topics, if discoverability matters to you.
